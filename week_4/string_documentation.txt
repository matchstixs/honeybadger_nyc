whenever you add a string to a number you concatnate ex. 1 + "1"= 11
var conCatString= `${hello} ${name}`;

string.split
//splits into array but removes split object

string.trim
//gets rid of white space ex. "  k       "

booleans are valuable when you need the program to make a decision
null is not really used

undefined is a temporary place holder that gets defined by function
later on

Nan (not a number) checks for number used to check for string input
instead of number

conditionals
//control flow statement that evaluates to true or false
== checks for condition only
=== checks for condition and data type
the only way a // can be false is if there is 2 false
the only way && can be true is if there is 2 true

if else statements leaks var into the global scope

array.forEach(function(arrayItem)){

}
