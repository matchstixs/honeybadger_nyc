function itself must be declared as async for it to work

// INDEX 
router.get('/', async function(req,res){
                    ^needs to be declared first before await function can be used
    const houses = await House.findAll() <- promise
                    ^ waits for promise before attributting to const
            res.send(houses);
        });
}); 


function can be replaced with => should not be used on event handlers, it binds this to parent scope
=> cannot be named
should not be used

    // INDEX 
router.get('/', (req,res) => {
    House.findAll() 
        .then(function(houses) {
            res.send(houses);
        });
});
